##Performing Agents

###Autonomous Robots as Performing Agents, Karl R. Wurst and Robert McCartney

After reading this article, I want to combine some part of the research with my define of robots. I think robots are extensions of human beings, which means robots have functions that humans have but more powerful and they can be extensions of humans' thoughts. For example, human cannpt explore the other planets by their physical bodies, but robots with specific materials and functions can. Accoridng to Robert, "performing agents are designed to entertain an audience through performance" (Robert, 56). So we have perforers and animations and so on in order to show tricks or express directors' thoughts to the audience. However, as I think that human beings have many limits and visiual arts are less entertaining and engaging that physical performance, here comes the appearance of performing agents. They can be mediums for the director to communicate with the audience through the communication between performing agents. I consider this as an extension of performing because there is something human cannot achieve without the help of robots while there are limits of visual arts.
