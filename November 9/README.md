## A Dramaturgy of Robots and Object-Figures

For most of the discussion in this article, there’s a pre-assumption that virtual figures and robots can seamlessly replicate humans.
New Media Dramaturgy brought up the trend of using projection, screens and other media. Here the robot is an object-figure parallel to virtual figures, and the objects can all activate sensibilities and operate on expressive dynamics. The point is that physical robots have pushed media into a more material direction. We now acknowledge the materiality of robots, while seeing them more than metaphors.
Different elements of a play (objects) could be thought of as dramaturgical agents, like lighting. Do they have their own character role in a play or are they simply agents? Is there a need to think about these objects as actors?
This conversation extends to robots, is a robot used to direct the plot or is it part of the main characters? I think the answer depends on the role of the robot in the scene, what do they act as in the performative environment? And the same answer goes for lighting and other elements of dramaturgy.

What’s “the needs of the machine.” For all the experiments we are doing, are they more responsive to humans or machines? Do we really want to cater to machine needs?
