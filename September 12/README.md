## Robots: Asleep, Awake, Alone and in Love

### Observations & Reactions:

- Ishiguro: "human-like appearance gives a robot a strong feeling of presence" (Whitehouse 2005).
I think if a robot has several functions without a human-like appearance, it will be treated like a tool or machine (Mechanical arms). However if it has a human-like appearance, people will more likely notice its presence and treat it a little bit more like treaing a creature. I consider this phenomenon as the start part of the Uncanny Valley, where people can have empathy on the robots.
- Moment: Robot sighs when it is shutted down. This is because of the exhalation of air as the pneumatics shut down, which also caused the hair to move. Velonaki had described the sensation of creaturely empathy she felt at this moment. Although it is not a part of the performance, this moment touched Velonaki because it is human-like. The sign is so real that people even feel it is a sign made by a creature that knows its life will be shutted down. Also, this robot has a human-like appearance, for example, the hair.
- Hyperobject: a class of objects that exceed the usual parameters of objecthood and massively exceed the space-time distribution of human presence (Morton, 2013).

- We can add robots to this list of hyperobjects: they can extend the performance parameters of human bodies (the extension of human beings) and operate, as Stelarc has noted, not only as extensions of human operational capacity but as entities interacting with human bodies where the human is the prosthesis for the robot and not the other way around (Stelarc, 2005). Compare this with the conception of cyborgs.

### Observations & Questions:

- Anna Munster: "Cyborgs, clone and robots can all be understood as protosubjectivities" (Munster, 64). What is the definition of protosubjectivity? Why can we consider Cyborgs and clone as the similar class with robots?
- Gibson: "Humans lack the comprehension to even imagine the possibility of an end of time, in a non-human world." Does this mean that in a non-human world, human become the prosthesis for robots? They start to lose some of their instincts such as feeling the end of time as robots. Which means that human start to put robots' characteristics on themselves rather than trying to put humans' characteristics on robots.
- Verdonck: "actually it doesn't really matter if robots have emotions or wheter they can think - it doesn't really matter, because our projection towards them is so big ... the most intimate thing that you can have is your teddy bear. It is an object. You take it to bed and it is your closest friend for years, and you tell it all your secrets, so that it becomes the most intimate relationship, and you can feel love for your teddy bear, I think ... objects don't need to produce our emotion. We will project emotion towards them" (Verdonck 2014b). I absolutely agree with this because I have had a teddy bear since I was 3 years old. I treat it as my closest companion. I wonder if this can be the key point to help people get rid of the Uncanny Valley.
