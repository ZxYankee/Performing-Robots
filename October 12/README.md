We designed a robot which looks horrible and this reminds me the famous movie series Jigsaw. Everytime Billy, the little robot puppet appears, I feel nervous and fear. So I found a dialogue from Jigsaw and read it in order to create a sence of fear. 

Our robot can only go straight forward but backward because of the motor issue. And it needs to turn around in order to change direction. Which makes our robot more humanoid because we seldom walk backward and we will turn around if we want to go back. So I think our robot is well designed to be an avatar of Jigsaw. (Just as Billy)

I also used the theme music Hello Zepp of the movie to emphsize the atmosphere. Moreover, Alpham managed to make the robot more scary by keep pushing the camera near the robot. I think he did a greate job of moving the camera and manipulating the lights.
