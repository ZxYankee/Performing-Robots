## Digital Theater - The ‘Other’ Actor

The concept of “partnership” would be formed as each adjusted to the movements of the other, and the co-presence of live and media characters can give a “sense of presence”/life to extinct characters.
In regards to the interactions between humans and robots, after reading this article, I argue that though it may be a personal preference thing, the core patterns of good interaction between humans and robots in regards to performance would be the same: robots can give real-time feedback to human performers and human audiences. Like the example of “Data” (created by Heather Knight from CMU), a robot that has a database that store jokes and more importantly, would adjust its behaviors after seeing audiences’ reactions (in the video, most people choose to wave the green paper, which means that they like the jokes, and Data thanks them in the end). This means that by inputting cutting-edge technologies such as computer vision, artificial intelligence into robots, they are able to give real-time feedback to human performers.
Based on this logic, I do not see why the question is even how humans will be “replaced” by robots in performance. Rather, I see value in thinking about it in terms of the impacts of the new genre of performance that uses machines/robots that has very limited ties with the existence of humans as performers.
